Provisioning from the OpenDXL Broker Console
============================================

If you are using OpenDXL-based brokers, you can provision clients either by
following the steps in the :doc:`basiccliprovisioning` section or by using the
OpenDXL Broker Console GUI. See the
`OpenDXL Broker Generate Client Configuration <https://github.com/opendxl/opendxl-broker/wiki/Generate-Client-Configuration-Page>`_
page for more information on the GUI-based provisioning approach.
